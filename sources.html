    <h1>Diversity in the Workplace</h1>
  The sources I found were data sets from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. These sources had data from seveeral years on the employemeent status of Americans for each type of position and had numerous tables and sorts by race, ethnicity, age, gender, and others. They had total numbers and percentages of each  category. I used it to find information on diversity of management positions. I also used the bea.gov to find information on GDP to track economic production. I also found statistics on innovation in companies from aerticles on jstor. I trust in all of these sources due to the location they come from. Either from government websites or well established databases. A summary of the data is GDP has been rasing the past years as well as minorities in mangement. I found a link between the two with minorities in mangement leading to innovation in companies which leads to a rise in GDP.
