    <h1>Diversity in the Workplace</h1>
    I chose to research this topic as someone who lives in America, I noticed that in upper level fields, there is not much diversity. I was intrigued as to see just how diverse or not it was and to find out if there is any data that gives reason as to why this is the case, as well as if the issue is being addressed.
