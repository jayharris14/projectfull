    <div class="be"><span>Studies have shown that there is a corelation between diversity in management and economic growth through measures of GDP. This is coupled with recent studies that show diversity in the management leads to innovation in the front office and better decision making. Both these factors have shown to increase GDP, explaining the correlation.  It is often thought that diversity in the workplace is a movement of equal opportunity intended to break down barriers and allow for fair treatment amongst everybody, but studies show not only does it do this, but it also helps the economy as well.</span></div>
